/*Coding Steps:

    Create a CRD application (CRUD without update) using json-server or another API
    Use fetch and async/await to interact with the API
    Use a form to create/post new entities
    Build a way for users to delete entities
    Include a way to get entities from the API and display them
    You do NOT need update, but you can add it if you'd like
    Use Bootstrap and/or CSS to style your project */

/*After a brainstorming session, I decided I wanted to create a "commission board"
where users could post, edit, and delete commissions. I am considering a toggle function
to switch between "available" and "taken" states, but that will be the last thing I work
on if I decide to do it at all.
The commissions themselves will include a title, risk rating, and description.
The title and description will be text inputs, and risk rating will be a dropdown menu.
As I will be using json-server I will create a few to display when the page is first opened.*/

/*Coming back to this after working with the HTML and CSS, I have decided to adjust my plan.
With how complicated I made the commissions, editing them would be difficult. I would likely
have to place edit options for each section seperately. However, toggling them between two states
would be more feasible, so I adjusted my buttons accordingly.*/
